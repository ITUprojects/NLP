Officer Jenny clears the disturbance, and tells Ash of a great big wave that comes every twenty years called Humunga Dunga. They decide to go surfing, although Misty warns Ash to continue on his training. She joins in on the fun. Ash gets on the wave, but falls. Pikachu notices another Pikachu on the cliff staring into the sea. It is looking for big waves for its owner to surf. Then a big wave comes, but Ash can't move his foot to get to safety. The Pikachu named Puka alerts its owner named Victor of Ash. Victor and Puka swoop in to save him. When Ash recovers, Victor tells of getting Puka from the sea, and how he wanted to be like Jan who was the only man to ever ride Humunga Dunga all the way to a tall peak where he planted his flag. Meanwhile, Team Rocket successfully capture the two Pikachu and brought them into their Mecha Gyarados. They did not get far, as they were stopped and blown away by some real Gyarados. Both Pikachu were flung into the air. Ash saves his with Bulbasaur. Puka falls in the water, so Victor throws it a surfboard, and dives. They both get to the surfboard and Puka feels the large wave, Humunga Dunga coming. Ash and the Group make it back to the shore to watch Victor and Puka ride the wave all the way to the top of the peak matching what Jan did so many years ago.

Meanwhile, Ash and friends are snooping around to discover a Jynx. Ash battles it, first with Pikachu, who's kissed to sleep, and then Charmander, who is successful. Jynx blocks Ash's Pokéball, and tells them that she was shining Santa's boot for him when she drifted away from the North Pole. Ash and the group try to take Jynx back to the North Pole, but the Pokémon get tired. As a last desperate attempt, Ash takes off his clothes and starts pulling everyone himself. He is stopped by a Lapras, who first tests them to make sure their intentions are good, then offers to help them the rest of the way to the North Pole. Team Rocket follows them all the way to the North Pole. When they finally make it, Jessie and James emerge from their Gyarados, all tired out. They say their motto, only to find themselves freezing cold. Meowth goes back in, under a nice warm blanket, and then he pushes the button to trap the group while they snatch the Jynx who Jessie thinks is Santa that took her doll. They soon find out that it wasn't Santa after all, and that the Jynx was only trying to help Jessie by fixing the doll. She gets the doll back from the real Santa, but isn't so grateful and ties him up. They take all the presents for Christmas, but are stopped by Lapras and Charmander. They still manage to escape with the presents, until all of Santa's Jynx use a combined Psywave attack to bring back the Mecha-Gyarados and get back the presents, and then make sure Team Rocket blasts off again. Back at Jessie and James' house they are sleeping in their bed, hoping Santa will have something for them. Jynx shows up at the window, and kisses them so they will sleep tight.
